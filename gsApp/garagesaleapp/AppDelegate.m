// FBSample logic
// The native facebook application transitions back to an authenticating application when the user
// chooses to either log in, or cancel. The url passed to this method contains the token in the
// case of a successful login. By passing the url to the handleOpenURL method of FBAppCall the provided
// session object can parse the URL, and capture the token for use by the rest of the authenticating
// application; the return value of handleOpenURL indicates whether or not the URL was handled by the
// session object, and does not reflect whether or not the login was successful; the session object's
// state, as well as its arguments passed to the state completion handler indicate whether the login
// was successful; note that if the session is nil or closed when handleOpenURL is called, the expression
// will be boolean NO, meaning the URL was not handled by the authenticating application
